# CS639: Mobile Application Development

## Overview
This repository contains the projects and assignments for the **CS639: Mobile Application Development** course, part of the 3rd semester of my Master's program in Computer Science at Pace University.

### Course Description
CS639 focuses on developing mobile applications, primarily for the Android platform. The course covers Android development using both Java and Kotlin, emphasizing UI/UX design, navigation, fragments, and integration with Android SDK features such as views, layouts, and resource management.

### Directories
The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **AboutMe**: This directory contains the project "About Me," which is an Android app built using Java. The app displays a biography screen with a custom layout, and has additional screens for hobbies and contact information, with full navigation functionality.
  
- **KotlinLesson1**: This directory contains the code for the first Kotlin lesson from the Android Development with Kotlin Pathway. It explores basic Kotlin syntax, control flow, and null safety.
  
- **KotlinLesson2**: This directory contains the code for the second Kotlin lesson from the Android Development with Kotlin Pathway. It delves deeper into Kotlin, covering topics like collections, lambdas, and higher-order functions.

- **MidtermFouzanAhmed**:
  - This project is an Android application that computes the area of a circle using the formula \[ \text{Area} = \pi \times r^2 \].
  - The application allows users to input the radius and calculates the area using \(\pi \approx 3.14\).
  - Includes the following deliverables:
    - XML layout for user input.
    - Logic for area calculation implemented in Kotlin.
    - Screenshots, APK, and a video demonstration of the app's functionality.

### Project Details
Each directory contains a `README.md` with more information about the project or lesson, along with instructions on how to run the code and links to the relevant Android development pathway resources.
