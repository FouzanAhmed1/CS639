# MidtermYourFirstName: Area of a Circle App

## Project Overview
This project is an Android application that computes the area of a circle based on user input for the radius. The formula used for the calculation is:

\[ \text{Area} = \pi \times r^2 \]

Where \( r \) is the radius of the circle (a double value) and \(\pi\) is approximated as 3.14.

## Project Requirements
- Design the app's user interface in XML.
- Implement the logic to calculate the area of a circle.
- Ensure the app is visually appealing and user-friendly.
- Test the app thoroughly after each implementation step.
